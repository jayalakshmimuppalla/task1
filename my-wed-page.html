<p style="font-size:15;"><big><b>Water</b> </big>efficiency is the practice of reducing water wastage by measuring the amount of water required for a particular purpose and the amount of water used or delivered.<br>[1] Water efficiency differs from water conservation in that it focuses on reducing waste, not restricting use.<br>[2] Solutions for water efficiency focus not only focus on reducing the amount of potable water used, but also on reducing the use of non-potable water where appropriate (i.e. flushing toilet, watering landscape, etc.).<br>[3] It also emphasises the influence consumers can have in water efficiency by making small behavioural changes to reduce water wastage, and by choosing more water efficient products.

<p style="font-size:15;"><big><b> Environmental policies </b></big>and the difference usages of models that are generated by these enforcement can have significant impacts on the society. <br>Hence, improving policies regarding environmental justice issues often require local government's decision making, public awareness, and significant amount of scientific tools.
